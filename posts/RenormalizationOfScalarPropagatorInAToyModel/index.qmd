# Background

Consider a mass-full scalar field $\phi$ coupling with a mass-less scalar field $\chi$, the toy model's total Lagrangian can be written as:
$$
\mathcal{L}_B = \partial_\mu \phi^* \, \partial^\mu \phi - m^2\phi^* \phi + {1 \over 2} \partial_\mu \chi \, \partial^\mu \chi - \lambda \phi^* \phi \chi
$$
So we have Feynmann rules for those particles (in momentum space):

- Vertex: $- i \lambda$
- $\phi$ propagator: $i\over{p^2 - m^2 + i \epsilon }$
- $\chi$ propagator: $i\over{p^2 + i \epsilon }$

Now we can consider a simple $\phi - \phi$ scattering process:

![Tree Level Feynmann Diagram](./images/pic1.svg)

The scattering amplitude of this diagram is simple:
$$
\mathcal{M}^{(0)} = - i {\lambda^2 \over q^2} 
$$
This is an u-channel diagram, for this process, there is also a s-channel diagram, these two together make up the first order of this scattering process, however, for our topic today, it's unrelated.

Then consider the following high-order diagram, in which the $\chi$ particle breaks in to a pair of virtual $\phi$ and anti-$\phi$ particle.

The amplitude of this new diagram is:
$$
\mathcal{M}^{(1)} = {\lambda^4 \over q^4} \int {d^4 k \over (2\pi)^4} {1 \over {k^2 - m^2 + i \epsilon}} {1 \over {(k-q)^2 - m^2 + i \epsilon}}
$$
One immediately sees this integral is divergent. The integral measure contains $|k|^3$, causes the result to diverge in the form of $\ln{|k|}$, and this does not make any sense, since this diagram is meant to be a small correction of the first diagram we've already covered. Something needs to be done to get a reasonable answer.

Further investigation of there two amplitudes, one will notice the effect of the second diagram is just multiplying some factor on to the propagator of $\chi$, which is:
$$
G_\chi^{(1)}=G_\chi^{(0)} \, \lambda^2 {i \over q^2} \, I(q)
$$
where
$$
I(q) = \int {d^4 k \over (2\pi)^4} {1 \over {k^2 - m^2 +i \epsilon}} {1 \over {(k-q)^2 - m^2 +i \epsilon}}
$$

# Calculating the integral
## Feynmann factorize

Start with rewriting the integral in a more manageable form, using the fact that:
$$
\begin{align*}
{1 \over {A B}} &= \int_0^1 dx {1 \over {[x A + (1-x) B]^2}} \\
&= \int_0^1 dx \int_0^1 dy \: \delta(x+y-1) \, {1 \over {[x A + y B]^2}} 
\end{align*}
$$
The factorized denominator is:
$$
\begin{align*}
D &= x(k^2 - m^2 +i \epsilon) + y[(k-q)^2 - m^2 +i \epsilon] \\
  &= k^2 - 2 y q k + y q^2 - m^2 + i \epsilon \\
  &= (k - yq)^2 + xyq^2 - m^2 + i \epsilon \\
  &= l^2 - \Delta + i \epsilon
\end{align*}
$$
In the third equal we've used $x + y = 1$. Finally by shifting $k$, which is just applying $l = k - yq$ and $\Delta = - xyq^2 + m^2$, the integral becomes:
$$
\int {d^4 k \over (2\pi)^4} {1 \over {k^2 - m^2 +i \epsilon}} {1 \over {(k-q)^2 - m^2 +i \epsilon}} \\
= \int_0^1 dx \int_0^1 dy \: \delta(x+y-1) \, {1 \over (2\pi)^4} \int {d^4 l} {1 \over {(l^2 - \Delta + i\epsilon)^2}}
$$

## Wick rotation

The integral is integrated over the 4-dimensional Minkowski space, which is tedious. However, one can apply Wick rotation to turn it in to a 4-dimensional Euclid space integral.

Focus on the integral over $l^0$:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dl^0 {1 \over {[(l^0)^2-|\vec{l}|^2 - \Delta + i \epsilon]^2}}
$$
The integral is real. However, this integral can be considered as a integral in the complex plane, the contour is around the upper-half of the complex plane, since obviously at $\infty$ things in the integral turn into zero. So the value of this integral only depends on the residue of singularities involved, which in the upper-half only have $l^0 = -\sqrt{|\vec{l}|^2+\Delta} + i \epsilon$, so the contour can be rotated to the left-half of the plane, resulting in:
$$
\int_{-i\infty}^{+i\infty}dl^0 {1 \over {[(l^0)^2-|\vec{l}|^2 - \Delta + i \epsilon]^2}}
$$
Then apply $l^0 = i l^4$:
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dl^0 {1 \over {[(l^0)^2-|\vec{l}|^2 - \Delta + i \epsilon]^2}} = i \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}dl^4 {1 \over {[- (l^4)^2 - |\vec{l}|^2 - \Delta + i \epsilon]^2}}
$$
Integral over the 4-Minkowski now transforms into a 4-dimensional Euclid integral. The $i\epsilon$ is no longer necessary, since there are no singularities on the complex-axis:
$$
\int {d^4 l} {1 \over {(l^2 - \Delta + i\epsilon)^2}} = i \int {d^4 \bm{l_E}} {1 \over {(\bm{l_E}^2 + \Delta )^2}}
$$

## Hard cut-off

One can calculate the integral by simply using the 4-dimensional spherical coordinate system, then apply a hard cut-off $\Lambda$ to $l_E$:：
$$
\int {d^4 \bm{l_E}} {1 \over {(\bm{l_E}^2 + \Delta)^2}} =\lim_{\Lambda \to + \infty} \int d\Omega_4 \int_{0}^{\Lambda}dl_E {{l_E}^3 \over {({l_E}^2 + \Delta)^2}}
$$
By the way, this cut-off is Lorenz invariant, sinces it's identical to a cut-off applied under Minkowski space. However, if one do the $l^0$ integral first then apply the cut-off, it's not Lorenz invariant. Then this integral is trivial:
$$
\begin{aligned}
\int_{0}^{\Lambda}dl_E {{l_E}^3 \over {({l_E}^2 + \Delta)^2}} &= {1 \over 2} \int_{0}^{\Lambda}d{l_E}^2 {{l_E}^2 \over {({l_E}^2 + \Delta)^2}} \\ 
&= {1 \over 2} \int_{0}^{\Lambda}d{l_E}^2 \left[{1 \over {{l_E}^2 + \Delta}} - {\Delta \over {({l_E}^2 + \Delta)^2}}\right] \\
&= {1 \over 2} \left( \ln{{\Lambda^2 + \Delta} \over \Delta} - {\Lambda^2 \over \Lambda^2  + \Delta} \right) \\
&= {1 \over 2} \left( \ln{{\Lambda^2} \over \Delta(x,y,q^2)} - 1 \right)
\end{aligned}
$$
Substitute all these result to the original inegral $I(q)$ (Integral over $d\Omega_4$ is $2 \pi^2$):
$$
I(q) = {i \over 16 \pi^2 } (\ln{\Lambda^2 \over \mu^2} - 1 - \int_0^1dx \ln{\Delta \over \mu^2})
$$
$\mu$ is an arbitrary number has unit of mass, which keeps the inside of $\ln$ pure number, but actually it's not necessary and won't effect our final answer.

## Renormalized $\chi$ propagator

Take account of other loop diagrams (loops are aligned along the $\chi$ propagator and do not have loops inside them), the total propagator of $\chi$ is:
$$
G_\chi(q) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}G_\chi^{(n)} ={i \over q^2 - i \lambda^2 I(q)}
$$
One will notice the divergent part of $I(q)$, which is $\ln\Lambda^2$, does not depend on $q$. That means if we introduce the exact mass term into $\chi$'s Lagrangian, the divergents cancels out:
$$
\mathcal{L} = \mathcal{L}_B - {1 \over 2}M^2\chi^2
$$
Where $M = {\lambda^2 \over 16 \pi^2} \ln{\Lambda^2 \over \mu^2} + M_0^2$. The introduce of $M_0$ is for keeping the original propagator under $q = 0$ limit.

So the corrected propagator is:
$$
G_\chi(q) = {i \over q^2 - {\lambda^2 \over 16 \pi^2}(\int_0^1dx\ln{\Delta \over \mu^2}+1)+M_0^2}
$$
Apply constrain at $G_\chi(0)$ will allow us to get $M_0^2 = {\lambda^2 \over 16 \pi^2}(\ln{m^2 \over \mu^2} + 1)$, then add back $i\epsilon$:
$$
G_\chi(q) = {i \over q^2 - {\lambda^2 \over 16 \pi^2}\int_0^1dx\ln(1-{x(1-x)q^2 \over m^2}) + i\epsilon}
$$
This is $\chi$'s "absolute" propagator. There is a mass-like term depending on $q^2$, which indicates different behaviour under different energy.

Now we've successfully solved the divergent introduced by the loop diagram, though $-\lambda\phi\phi^*\chi$ vertex and $\phi$ propagator can also generate divergent, however they can be treated using the same manner. If we try to do this under QED, gamma matrixes and tensor algebra will be invoded, making it more tedious.
